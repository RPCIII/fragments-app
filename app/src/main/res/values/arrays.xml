        <item>The Hand of God is a pulsar wind nebula, which is a cloud of material ejected by an exploding star. The
        particles interact with magnetic fields surrounding them, causing them to glow like an x-ray.</item>
        <item>The Ghost Nebula is classified as two different nebulas; reflection and emission. It is both reflecting
        the light of nearby star and emitting its own light via radiation. However, radiation from the nearby star
        is causing this nebula to dissipate.</item>
        <item>This nebula received its name from its resemblance to a witch\'s head; it is a reflection nebula and
        gets its color through the light of a nearby star in combination with the dust grains that comprise it. The star from
        which it receives light is part of the constellation Orion.</item>
        <item>This star, Tycho, was once a white dwarf. It is the remnants of a supernova that has accumulated
        mass from a nearby star to the point where it exploded a second time, deeming it the nickname \"Zombie Star\".</item>
